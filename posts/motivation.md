I've always been a very hyperactive person, so it was hard to focus on the same thing for a long period of time,
studying the same subject for more than 30 minutes was painful, and I coundn't absorb any of the knowledge properly.

And when I entered the tech field, things got worse, every programmer knows that our area demands that we be constant learners,
and keep up with every new thing that could be the next most powerful tool for our job. 

Well, as you can expect, I didn't had a good time at the start, but after some experiements and trying new methods, i've came up 
with some useful tips that can help people like me that at the same time want to learn everything and be a good professional, cant keep up with 
the insane rythm that it demands.

Beware that these tips can work in any field, but i'll be using tech examples because its what i'm used to.

### 0 - Divide and conquer

If something seems too complicated and complex, it probably can be divided in multiple small parts.

At the start I've always tried to make those gigantic projects with multiple things, graphl, database, react, business rules, and all that jazz.
I dont even need to say that all of those ideas ended up on my github unfinished or barely started on my local machine.

Slowly I realized that the important thing is to learn the small things first, you dont need to make a giant project at first, start small, and scale up as you learn.

You'll slowly notice that you can learn a lot even when studying "small" subjects that seem quite simple at the start like authentication, database modeling, how to structure your project, what bundler to use, how to host it etc.

### 1 - Focus on the tools

When trying to learn new tools and utilities in programming, I always ended up stuck when trying to come up with a cool project idea to test said tools.
And that was the main thing that drawed me out of focus. 

You dont need a revolutionary, neither a "fun" idea to make up to your studying goals, keep it simple, so you can focus only at what your are actually trying to learn.

Find a simple idea and stick to it, like the well known "to-do list". 

Want to learn graphql? make a todo list with graphql

Websockets? Real time todo list update with websockets

Rest api? todo list...

And so on.

### 2 - Write things up

I've once heard a professor saying that, in order to actually learn something, you have to write it up, the proccess of writing will make your brain
exercise itself and fixate the important parts of the subject, and also, writing makes a good pocket note for later reminding of things that you will eventually forget.

### 3 - Teach yourself along

One of the most efective ways of proving that you learned something is to teach it to somebody else. 

So based on that, and using my hyperactive head that didnt stop thinking for just a second, I started to do all things talking to myself, like I was teaching somebody to do that thing. 

You dont actually need to talk, but just inside your head, pretend that you are actually teaching someone to do what you just learned, this will help you understand some points that you might have missed during the proccess.

### 4 - Small goals

Kepping the bar too high when learning something will only lead you into frustration, try to always keep small goals.

With small tasks and goals its easy to keep you in that "success" flow all the time, marking 10 very small things in a study checklist is better than having one unique giant task that will never get marked.


Thats it my friends, I hope i could share my 5 cents of knowledge, I'm always open to feedback, didn't agree with some of my points? feel free to write me up on social media via my links, lets discuss. Its always about learning!
