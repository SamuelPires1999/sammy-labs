I've always been a very hyperactive person, so it was hard to focus on the same thing for a long period, studying the same subject for more than 30 minutes was painful, and I couldn't absorb any of the knowledge properly.

And when I entered the tech field, things got worse, every programmer knows that our area demands that we be constant learners, and keep up with every new thing that could be the next most powerful tool for our job.

Well, as you can expect, I didn't have a good time at the start, but after some experiments and trying new methods, I've come up with some useful tips that can help people like me that at the same time want to learn everything and be good professional, can't keep up with the insane rhythm that it demands.

Beware that these tips can work in any field, but I'll be using tech examples because it's what I'm used to.

### 0 - Divide and conquer

If something seems too complicated and complex, it probably can be divided into multiple small parts.

At the start, I've always tried to make those gigantic projects with multiple things, graphl, databases, react, business rules, and all that jazz. I don't even need to say that all of those ideas ended up on my GitHub unfinished or barely started on my local machine.

Slowly I realized that the important thing is to learn the small things first, you don't need to make a giant project at first, start small, and scale up as you learn.
You'll slowly notice that you can learn a lot even when studying "small" subjects that seem quite simple at the start like authentication, database modeling, how to structure your project, what bundler to use, how to host it etc.

### 1 - Focus on the tools

When trying to learn new tools and utilities in programming, I always ended up stuck when trying to come up with a cool project idea to test said tools. And that was the main thing that drew me out of focus.

You don't need a revolutionary, or a "fun" idea to make up for your studying goals, keep it simple, so you can focus only on what you are trying to learn.
Find a simple idea and stick to it, like the well-known "to-do list".

Want to learn graphql? make a todo list with graphql

Websockets? Real-time todo list update with websockets

Rest API? todo list...

And so on.

### 2 - Write things up

I once heard a professor saying that to learn something, you have to write it up, the process of writing will make your brain exercise itself and fixate on the important parts of the subject, and also, writing makes a good pocket note for later reminding of things that you will eventually forget.

### 3 - Teach yourself along

One of the most effective ways of proving that you learned something is to teach it to somebody else.
So based on that, and using my hyperactive head that didn't stop thinking for just a second, I started to do all things talking to myself, like I was teaching somebody to do that thing.

You don't need to talk, but just inside your head, pretend that you are teaching someone to do what you just learned, this will help you understand some points that you might have missed during the process.

### 4 - Small goals

Keeping the bar too high when learning something will only lead you to frustration, try to always keep small goals.
With small tasks and goals, it is easy to keep you in that "success" flow all the time, marking 10 very small things in a study checklist is better than having one unique giant task that will never get marked.
That's it, my friends, I hope I could share my 5 cents of knowledge, I'm always open to feedback, didn't agree with some of my points? feel free to write me up on social media via my links, Let's discuss. It's always about learning!
